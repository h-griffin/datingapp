# ======= SECTION 1 =======
## API learning goals
- walking skeleton 
    - put data in database
    - make api to get data
    - make angular app to query api and get data
    - display in browser

- learning goals
    - use dotnet cli
    - api controllers and endpoints
    - entity framework
    - api project structure
    - config and env variables
    - source control (github)

## set up & run application
- check if dotnet sdk is installed
    - `dotnet --info `
- template : ASP.NET Core Web API 
    - `dotnet new sln`

    - `dotnet run`
- trust cetificate for sdk (https)
    - cancel server
    - `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`
    - `dotnet run`
    - 5001 cant be found (api project)
        - look at controller: json shows for localhost:5001/weatherforecast (default from template)
    - controller end point (httpGet)

- **appsettings.Development.json**
    - change "Microsoft" log level from warning to information

- **Startup.cs** 
    - configure services "dependency injection" - give other parts of application acess

## finishing walking skeleton
-  adding new controller
    - add endpoints - users & user
- making code asynchronous & scalable
    - async Task & await
- saving changes into source control
    - use github



# ========= SECTION 2 =========

## Angular Client learning goals
    - use angular cli
    - how to create angular app
    - angular project files
    - angular bootstrap process
    - using angular http client service
    - run angular app over https
    - add packages with npm
        - font awesome
        - bootstrap

## create angular app client (angular cli)
- inside datingapp dir 
- cd datingapp/
- `npm install -g @angular/cli@7.1.0`
- `ng new client --skip-tests --style=css`
    - yes strict (should have said no)
    - yes angular routing
- cd datingapp/client
- `ng serve`

- contents
    - angular apps are single page
    - <app-root> class
    - typescript decorator (@Component) - normal class can be used as component

- interpolation : give data from component to template view
    - set variable in comp and use with double braces {{}}

## vs code extensions to use angular
- angular language service by angular
- angular snippets by john papa
- bracket pair colorizer 2 by conraadS

## HTTP requests in angular component
- add angular module **app.module.ts**
    - imports :[ HttpClientModule ]

- http naturally async request 
    - angular component constructor too early for async req
    - use initialization lifecycle

- typescript gives type safety unless you use `any` as user property;
- observable : how Typescript handles asynchronous code
- subscribe : get data from observable

## adding cors in API
- cross origin resource sharing
- blocks all front end request from any api not in same origin (local ports are different)
- must supply header to specify its ok

- add service for cors
    - configure services -order does not matter
    - configure - must be between routing and endpoints, and before use auth

## display users in client
- a-ng if
- li component : does not display without the content, displays for dynamic content
- curly braces in html

## adding bootstrap and fontawesome
- using jquery to adjust messes with angular 
- use angular bootstrap (ngx bootstrap)
- `ng add ngx-bootstrap`
- `npm install font-awesome`

## using https in mac OSX
- set up angular to use ssl
- take certificate and key from assets file (development only cert)
- double click cert, expand trust, always trust
- turn on ssl
```
serve{
"sslCert": "./ssl/server.crt",
"sslKey": "./ssl/server.key",
"ssl": true,
```

- https cors error, must allow https
- .gitignore ssl folder (cert and key)



# ========= SECTION 3 =========

## Authentication learning goals
- basic authentication and storing passwords
- inheritance in c# (DRY 'do not repeat yourself')
- using c# debugger
- using data transfer objects (DTOs)
- validation
- JSON web tokens (JWTs)
- using services in c#
- middleware
- extension methods - DRY

## where do i start
- app requirements:
- users should
    - log in 
    - register
    - view other users
    - message other users

## storing passwords in the database
- **X** storing in clear text
- use ssl to encrypt 
```
id  user  password
1   bob   pass
2   tom   password
3   jane  pw
```

- **X** use a password hasher
- hash is the same
- protects full database except the one password
```
id  user  password
1   bob   324234 <
2   tom   355334
3   jane  324234 <
```

- **âˆš** hash and salting password
- scrambles the hash
- protects people that use same password
```
id  user  password   passwordSalt
1   bob   324234 <  436463 <
2   tom   355334    646868 
3   jane  324234 <  323534 < 
```

## update user entity
- add properties
- create new migration
    - stop API
    - `dotnet ef migrations add UserPasswordAdded`
    - `dotnet ef database update`
- 'byte' type shows as 'blob' this is ok

## new controller to manage login/registration
- create BaseApiController
- UsersController now derives from :BaseApiController instead of :BaseController

## create account controller and register users
- create AccountController
- HMAC - built in disposal

- register user test (postman)
    - 404 restart server (added new controller)

- why?
    - user : status 500
    - user string : status 200 

## using the debugger
- mac vscode
    - breakpoint at register user
    - exe - windows // dll - mac

- api controller cannot find passwords (must be sent as an object) ,must tell where/how to find
    - GetBytes(password) cannot take null 

## adding validation (prevent empty string username)
- add validation at DTO level
- validation comes built in because of [ApiController] tag

## clear/reset database
- `dotnet ef database drop`
- `dotnet ef database update`

## token authentication
- json web token 
    - industry standard
    - self contained, can contain
        - credentials
        - claims
        - other info
    
    - structure : long string separated by period
        - header : algorithm and type
            - algorithm used to encrypt in 3rd part
        - payload : identifiers and claims
        - signature : encrypted
            - encrypted by server key that never leaves server

- token authentication
    - send username password to server
    - server sends token to store on machine
    - sends token back for/with each req
    - server that signed token has access to key
    - server verifies token and sends back response
- benefits
    - no session to manage
    - single token with multiple back ends (if they share same signature/key)
    - no cookies required (mobile friendly)
    - once given a token no need to ask for verification again

## create jwt service
- receive app user and create/return jwt to account controller
- interface
    - contract between self and class
    - interface gets this classes properties/methods/events
    - no implementation logic only functionality provided by signature
- prefix interfaces with I

- add in startup.cs configureServices
    - add scoped (lifetime of http request)
- do not need interface for token service, easier to test an interface

## creating token handler / jwt token
- nuget gallery extension: System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt 
- create key, creds, decoder

- add to log in register 
- change account controller returning user to UserDTO

## authentication middleware
- add authorized attribute
- add middleware to authenticate jwt token
- nuget gallery extension: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer

- 401 unauthorized
    - need to send jwt with req
    - for now add in manually in header

## adding extension methods
- add methods to existing types without creating or modifying type
- extension needs to be static : does not need new instance
- use this before specifying type of extension



# ========= SECTION 4 =========

## client log in/register learning goals
- create components with angular cli
    - components must be registered 
- angular template forms
- angular services (vs API calls)
- understanding observables (api calls)
- structural directives (conditionally display elements)
- component communication using input and output properties
    - parent to child
    - child to parent

## adding nav bar component
- `cd client/src/app`
- `ng g -h` ng generate help
- `ng g c nav --skip-tests` 
    - generate componenet nav skip test file
- nav added to ng declarations in app.module.ts
- add app-nav tag in appComponent.html
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/carousel/ 
    - copy nav element into nav.component.html
- adjust html 

## filling out form and getting token
- import angular forms module in app module.ts
- #loginform="ngForm" attribute makes it an angular form

- `[(ngModel)]="binding"`
    - ng model "banana in a box" 
    - square[] receive from component
    - both [()] is two way binding with component

- `cd client/src/app/_services`
- `ng g s account --skip-tests`
    - generate service account
- service can be injected into other components and services 
- angular service is singleton
    - once initialized it will stay initialized until application is disposed (user closes browser)
    - angular components are destroyed when not in use - services stay
- account service will make req to API
- =assign :type

## injecting services into components
- inject in nav.component.ts
- login returns an observable : does nothing until you subscribe

## conditionals
- hide links until logged in
- `*ngIf="loggedIn"` bool set in nav component

- adding drop down functionality
- for root : has services and components that need to be initialized 

- bootstrap class style shortcuts "mt-3" = margin-top: 3px

## observables 
- standard for ES7 (ES2016) (compatible is ES2015)
- introduced in angular v2
- lazy collections of multiple values over time
    - going to use for http request and components change for value changes
- news letter, only subscribers get print
- promise (like: .then)
    - single future value
    - not lazy (regardless if no one is listening)
    - can not cancel
- observable
    - multiple values over time
    - lazy (no one subscribe)
    - able to cancel
    - can use with map, filter, reduce, etc
        - can use map to edit data before passing it along
        - chain a pipe to chain functions to edit data
        - .subscribe (what to do next)
        - .error (if theres an error)
        - () anon , console log
        - can use ToPromise()
        - loses extra functionality but is simple
    - can use async pipe | to automatically sub/unsub
    
## persisting log in
- store in local storage
- interface in typescript - specify something is a type of something
- replay subject - buffer object stores values and each subscribe omits last value inside it (or more)
- observable gets $ at end of variable
- !!user;  turns obj into boolean

- async pipe in nav component

## adding home page component
- cd client/src/app 
- `ng g c home --skip-tests`
- add <app-home> comp in appComponent.html

## create form 
- cd client/src/app 
- `ng g c register --skip-tests`
- use ng ifs for dynamic display

## parse data from parent to child
- down from home to register
- move get users functionality from app to home

- inside home app register tag [usersFromHomeComponent]="users"

- inside register option selector tag
*ngFor="let user of usersFromHomeComponent" [value]="user.userName" 

- must call getUsers() in init()

## child to parent
- cancel button in register needs to turn off task in home
- needs to turn off register mode
- 1 output property
- 2 what to emit when clicked
- [home comp template] inside child
    - receiving []
    - output ()
- 3 add cancel register method in home component
- 4 call method in element

## finish registration
- register users from client
- account service register()
- register component register with account services
    - register then hide form



# ========= SECTION 5 =========

## routing learning goals
- angular routing (single page application)
    - navigate different components rather than pages
- adding bootstrap theme
- angular route guards
- using shared module (rather than just app)

## more components to route to
- cd client/src/app
- mkdir members
- cd members (client/src/app/members)
- `ng g c member-list --skip-tests`
- `ng g c member-detail --skip-tests`
- cd .. (client/src/app)
- `ng g c lists --skip-tests`
- `ng g c messages --skip-tests`

- app routing generated from app set up (yes to angular routing)
- set up routes in app-routing-module

## add nav links
- replace href with angular routing `routerLink="/"`
- apply active with ` routerLinkActive="active"` on each a tag

- routing in code
- inject router in nav comp
- once logged in router to members page
- clear user information from login form on logout later

- toast service for notifications
- cd client
- `npm install ngx-toastr`

## prevent acces to routes - route guards
- cd client/src/app/_guards
- `ng g guards auth --skip-tests`
    - canActivate interface

- authguard automatically subscribes to all observables
- add dummy route to group all protected paths together
    - paths []

- ng container - for conditionsls 
    - does not generate html so does not affect styling 
    - appears as comment in page/element inspection

## adding a new BS theme
- cd client
- `npm install bootswatch`
- add stylesheet in angular.json
- restart client

- welcome 'user' username
- grab user value from ng if account service
- use title case pipe

## use shared module
- cd client/scr/app
- mkdir _modules
- cd _modules
- ` ng g m shared --flat`
    - generate module (flat no folder) (modules have no test files)
- replace files in shared module with shared module import in app module



# ========= SECTION 6 =========

## error handling learning goals
- api middleware
    - client and api
- angular interceptors
    - requests adn responses
- trouble shooting exceptions

## error controller
- add controllers to return errors
- errors successfully set up in buggy
    - 401 unauthorized
    - 404 not found
    - 500 null ref exception
    - 400 bad request
- user/pw validation set up in register dto
    - username exists
    - password 4 - 8 characters

- null ref comes from dev exception page from startup cs
- without dev page 500 
- without dev page use try catch blocks

- exception caught inside block does not appear in console (bad) only too client

## building exception handling middleware
- create apiException class to return for all exceptions

- create exception middleware class
    - request delegate : what happens next in middleware pipeline
    - ILogger : log exception in terminal
    - IHostEnvironment : what environment (production?development?)
- passing context to next middleware will pass exception up the tree until something can handle it
- context writes message to response

## handling errors in the client
- cd client/src/app/errors
- `ng g c test-errors --skip-tests`
- add methods in testErrorsComponent.ts
- display in test errors template .html
- add route in appRoutingModule.ts
- add nav link to error page

## use http interceptors
- handle errors at global level
- cd client/app
- mkdir _interceptors
- cd _interceptors
- `ng g interceptor error --skip-tests`

- inject router for errors that have a page
- inject toastr for errors that just need notification

- 400 validation error
    - provide interceptor in appModuleProviders.ts
    - this is custom interceptor being added to other built in interceptors
    - add newer version (es2019)of js in tsconfig.json
        - so you can use .flat() on error interceptor
- 404 not found
    - add component to reroute to
    - cd client/src/app/errors 
    - `ng g c not-found --skip-tests`
    - add component
    - add new link/route appRoutingModule.ts

- remove error handling inside login() navComponent.ts to remove double toast

- 500 server error
    - add component to reroute to
    - cd client/src/app/errors 
    - `ng g c server-error --skip-tests`
    - add component
    - add new link/route app routing module

- problem is not with angular/client if you can reproduce in postman
- stack trace will not be visible in production
- wild route component switch to not found page

- building blocks in place to expand application safely



# ========= SECTION 7 =========

## Extending API learning goals
- implement further functionality of API
- entity framework relationships (currently one flat table)
- entity framework conventions
- seeding data into database
- repository pattern
    - abstracting away from db context class
- using auto mapper
    - for big entities to send one property to another

## extending user entity 
- add properties for user info
- add phot class for photo information to store in db

## generating dat of birth with extension methods
- put logic for calculating age in extension and return age in appUser.ts

## entity framework relationships
- relationship between user and photos
- one to many - one user can have many photos

- stop api
- `dotnet ef migrations add ExtendedUserEntity`

- photos column
    - id
    - url
    - isMain
    - pubic id
    - user id <<<<
- entity framework recognizes relationship with user and generates appUser 
- generated foreign key to user table [app user id as foreign key]
    - **X** app user is allowed to be null !!! this can remove a way to get the photos without a user

- on delete referential action restrict
    - user delete does not remove photos

- remove migration
- `dotnet ef migrations remove`
- enable cascading delete and do not let user be nullable
    - fully defining relationship
- tell photo entity about app user class

- new migration 
- `dotnet ef migrations add ExtendedUserEntity`
- `dotnet ef database update`
- command+shift+p open sqlite db to check tables

## populate table with seed data
- lazy and efficient
- generate json data to insert
- https://www.json-generator.com/

```
[
  '{{repeat(5)}}',
  {
    UserName: '{{firstName("female")}}',
    Gender: 'female',
    DateOfBirth: '{{date(new Date(1950,0,1), new Date(1999, 11, 31), "YYYY-MM-dd")}}',
    KnownAs: function(){ return this.UserName; },
    Created: '{{date(new Date(2019, 0, 1), new Date(2020,5,30), "YYYY-MM-dd")}}',
    LastActive: '{{date(new Date(2020, 4, 1), new Date(2020,5,30), "YYYY-MM-dd")}}',
    Introduction: '{{lorem(1, "paragraphs")}}',
    LookingFor: '{{lorem(1, "paragraphs")}}',
    Interests: '{{lorem(1, "sentences")}}',
    City: '{{city()}}',
    Country: '{{country()}}',
    Photos: [
        {
          Url: function(num) {
          return 'https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/' + num.integer(1,99) + '.jpg';
        },
        IsMain: true
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

- 5 female users
    - Teri
    - Lucy
    - Zoey
    - Anne
    - Emma
- 5 male users
    - Todd
    - Luke
    - Dave
    - Mike
    - John

## seeding data (put in db)
- create seed class
- read json file and put in db
- create static (one instance)
- pull users from json file and convert to appUser obj
- hard code pw for seed users

- seed data where application starts (program.cs)
-  `dotnet ef database update`
    - now just restart application

- drop existing database
- `dotnet ef database drop`
- restart api
- `dotnet watch run`

## repository pattern
- a repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection

```
web server
  v    ^
controller   <> db context
                  v    ^
                database

controller talks to dbcontext
```

- req into api 
- requests come into request controllers,
- controllers have dbcontext injected,
- represents session in database and sees queries written in controller 
- and gets them from database

- changing so controller does not go directly to dbcontext
- goes to repository which uses db context

- just adding another layer

```
web server
  v    ^
controller <> repository <> db context
                            v    ^
                            database

controller talks to repository that talks to dbcontext
```

- db set in dbcontext is like repository 
- encapsulates the logic
- reduce duplicate query logic 

```
        controllers
user        message     likes
set user    set user    set user

        repository
        set user
```

- easier to test against interface of repository rather than dbcontext
- repositories will have interfaces and implementations classes with log
- testing can be mocked
- 

- advantages
- minimizes duplicate query logic
- decouples application from persistance framework (entity already does)
- all database queries are centralized and not scattered throughout app  (entity does not)
- allows us to change ORM easily * (do not usually change orm)
- easily mock repository interface

- disadvantages
- abstraction of abstraction
    - entity framework already abstraction of database, repository is abstraction from entity framework
- each root entity should have its own repository which means more code
- also need to implement 'unit of work' pattern to control transactions

## creating a repository
- create tasks the users can do (update save etc) IUserRepository.cs
- fill actions in userRepository.cs
- add repository to app in application service extensions

## updating users repository
- replace dataContext with repository in userController
- eager loading : load photos
- for each photo it will try to return an app user (will loop each other)
- shape data before return ing using a DTO

## adding a DTO for members
- copy app user props into member dto
- move photo info into photDto 
- instead of app user return memberDTo in userController

## adding auto mapper
- nuget gallery extension: AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection by Jimmy Bogard
- create api/Helpers
- autoMapperProfiles
- maps from one obj to another
- <> map from - to
- add to application to service extensions to be able to inject in other classes

## Using auto mapper
- use mapper in users controller to get user/s
- smart enough to recognize properties that are named the same (app user and memberDto)
- member dto us Username (not UserName) to use in angular application
- autoMapper will automatically calculate age because of getAge() in appUser
- auto populates all the fields except for 
photo url with main photo url

## configuring autoMapper
- populate photo url with main photo url
- use forMember to tell it how to get to the photo

- not very efficient
- easy is not optimal

```
CreateMap<AppUser, MemberDto>()
                .ForMember(dest => dest.PhotoUrl, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.Photos.FirstOrDefault(x => x.IsMain).Url));
```

## autoMapper query-able extensions
- first must get user from db and include photos then pass it back to controller 
- controller puts entity in memory then map from one obj from another
- can this be efficient?

- add get member methods in IUser repository that return memberDtos instead of appUser
-  implement the new methods in useRepository with logic 
- currently selecting all properties even those we do not need to return 
- not very efficient

```
// no autoMapper
return await _context.Users 
    .Where(x => x.UserName == username)
    .Select(user => new MemberDto{
        Id = user.Id,
        Username = user.UserName
        // etc manually map out every property
    }).SingleOrDefaultAsync();
```

```
return await _context.Users
    .Where(x => x.UserName == username)
    .ProjectTo<MemberDto>(_mapper.ConfigurationProvider)
    .SingleOrDefaultAsync();
```

- still selecting extra properties
- because of get age in app user
- if it wants to automatically use getAge() in appUser it must pull the full file
- comment out getUser() in 

```
CreateMap<AppUser, MemberDto>()
                .ForMember(dest => dest.PhotoUrl, opt => opt        // grab from memberdto
                .MapFrom(src => src.Photos                          //
                .FirstOrDefault(x => x.IsMain).Url))                //
                .ForMember(dest => dest.Age, opt => opt             // 
                .MapFrom(src => src.DateOfBirth.CalculateAge()));
```
- more efficient to import calculate age inline so it only pulls what we need
- with projection we do not need include (photos)



# ========= SECTION 8 =========

## building out user interface learning goals
- implement components that make up user interface 
- using typescript types
- using async pipe to retrieve data
- using bootstrap for styling
- basic ccs tricks to enhance look
- using 3rd party photo gallery

## using typescript
- type script inferring - can guess you value type if not specified
- can user pipe to allow more than one type

```let data: number | string = 42;

data = "10"
```
```
interface Car {
  color: string;
  model: string;
  topSpeed?: number; << optional 
}
```

## create types for what is returned from api members
- types for members
- take member json returned in postman
- http://www.jsontots.com/

## creating members service
- move base url string to environment
- cd app/_services
- `ng g s members --skip-tests`
- specify teh types that the http get req is getting

## getting members from member list component
- cd app/members
- `ng g c member-card --skip-tests`

- css encapsulation
- with this ^^ you cannot reach elements inside another component with css
- to use global css set encapsulation to none in member card components
- use component css file to prevent global overrides

## add animated buttons
- profile 
- like
- messages

- absolute position buttons
- relatively positioned wrapper

## using interceptor to send token
- cd app/_interceptors
- `ng g interceptor jwt --skip-tests`

- user is currently observable
- must pull user out of observable to get token (subscribe)
- .pipe(take(1) ) unsub when the user completed taking 
- bearer bust have a space between the token
- this sends token with each request now
-  no longer need httpsOptions in members service
- provide interceptor in app modules

## member detail page
- on profile click use the username to reach user route
- cannot read from undefined
- order of execution
- angular creates template after users
- add ng conditional to add member if there is one

## tab component
- https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/tabs

- tabs does not turn off encapsulation
- cant style much inside angular component
- give class an adjust in global style sheet
- add tabsheet styles from assets

## add photo gallery
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kolkov/ngx-gallery

- cd client
- `npm install @kolkov/ngx-gallery`
- add in shared module

- gallery images in init
- cannot read photos of undefined 
- timing error - execution order

- move get images to end of load member 

# ========= SECTION 9 =========

## update resources learning goals
- angular template forms
- can Deactivate route guard
    - prompt user when they click away mid form
- @viewChild decorator
- persisting changes to api
    - update user
- loading indicators in client
- caching data in angular services

## member edit component
- cd app/members
- `ng g c member-edit --skip-tests`
- add route for component in appRouting 
- put link in nav component (dropdown)
- load up current signed in user to edit

## edit form template
- copy all of member detail into member edit
- convert to inputs
- copy member detail css to member edit (because of encapsulation)

## 
- convert form to ng form
- connect save changes button to form 
- if form is dirty display alert
- reset form state after save changes
- form name bust be same as property or text will disappear on save

## cn deactivate route guard
- save changes before leaving page

- cd guards
- `ng g guard prevent-unsaved-changes --skip-tests`
- can deactivate

- add confirm in prevent unsaved changes
- add guard in app routing 
- closing tab or going outside angular application does not work

## persisting changes made
- member update dto
- want to map into user entity 
- create new automapper for update

- http put wil be the only put so it is unique from httpget

- do not need to send obj back client already has what is updated
- get username from token used to authenticate

- mapper.map from-to
    - without you would have to manually set all properties, not with automapper
- check in postman that updates update

## updating user in client
- add update member method in member service
- update the update member method in member edit cop

## adding loading indicators
- make app slower its too fast/jarring
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-spinner

- cd client
- `ng add ngx-spinner`
    - err needs angular cdk
- `npm install @angular/cdk`
    - updates upp module
    - does not need to be in shared module

- cd src/app/_services
- `ng g s busy --skip-tests`

- set up methods to show and hide spinner

- cd src/app/_interceptors
- `ng g interceptor loading --skip-tests`

- inject busy service
- add interceptor in app module
- add spinner component 

- add spinner in app component.html (root)

- member service is singleton once loaded it lives until page quit
- services good place for state (kind of like redux)

- adjust methods to hold members after first load
- change member array to observable of member array in member list component



# ========= SECTION 11 =========

## photo upload learning goals
- photo storage options
    - keep in mind aspect ratio
- adding related entities
    - cannot add directly, must be added to user entity 
- third party api
- using the debugger (again)
- update and delete resources in api controller
- what to return when creating rescources in a REST api
    - 'REST' representational state transfer
    - standards that apply to apis
    - this will not be fully restful

## storing photos
- database as binary large objects
    - not efficient with large objects
    - space consumption
- file system
    - optimized for serving files
    - space consumption
- cloud service
    - storage unlimited

- cloudinary (10 gb free)
    - provides image transform
    - this app will be square images only

## image upload
- drag and drop
- only authenticatd users can 
- 1 client uploads photo to api with jwt
- 2 securely upload photo to cloudinary (api keys)
- 3 cloudinary stores photo and sends reponse
    - api saves url
    - cloud gives public id of image (save this in db)
    - saved in db and given auto generated id
    - 201 created response sent to client with location header
    - 

- https://cloudinary.com/
- square image site (easy css)
- cloudinary gives auto crop

## install configuring cloudinary in api
- nuget extension: CloudinaryDotNet by Cloudinary

- configure in app setting s.json (not on github safe for api keys)
- stongly typed
- set props in cloudinary settings .cs
- add in application service extensions
- access config via cloudinary settings class in spplication service extensions

## adding photo service
- adding deleting photos
- one responsibility
    - receice file
    - upload and receive url from clud
    - upload results to who needs it

- interface photo servece
- each phot has public id, use this to delete
- implement interface in photo service
- new account settings must be 
    - cloud name
    - api key
    - api secret

- upload image and crop to 500x500 centered on face
- add service in application service extensions 

## updating user controller
- allow add photo
- client neeeds to know id and if it is main
- add extension method to get username faster

## testing photo uploading
- add breakpoint on var result line
- watch each step as request populates file ingo and cloudinary info

- photos wil lnot get their own route, only see user ohotos at member detail page

## created at route methof
- return photo in body of request

```
("GetUser", _mapper.Map<PhotoDto>(photo));     // return 201 with route to user that has ohotos
                                                                                // doesnt work route req parameters
```

## photo editing component
- add photos in client
- cd client/src/app/members
- `ng g c photo-editor --skip-tests`

- add photo in user.ts
- account service
    change local storage from register to set current user
- acc service now has access to main photo
- nav component html
- 500 server error
    - account controller l66
    - return new user dto
    - first or default tells if source is empty(system argument null exception) 
    - why does user photos have no object/source?
    - injecting data context in account controller (not return photo with login )
    - eager load photos in login

## update mian image in client
- set main photo method in member service
- set main photo method in photo editor components
    these can go anywhere computer can figure out, location is for passing down and where human can remember
    - set main photo: reset current user to load observable and local storage img
    - loop through each photo to reset what is main
- photo editor comp html

## delete photo in client
- users controller

    - easier to test
- angular validation inputs
- custom validators
- implement reusable form controls
- working with date inputs

## registration of users 
- import reactive forms module in app module
- initialize form settings in register component
- instead of template ref variable (#) replace w input prop form group []=""
    - ng models replaces with form control name

## client side validation
- add angular validators, multi in array
- need custom for confirm password

## custom validators
- check validator values against each other
- extra check for pw change after pw check is valid

- reuse validators to replace all the validation html

## reusable text input
- cd app/_forms
- `ng g c text-input --skip-tests`
- add control value accessor
- inject control into constructor 
- setup injectable into text input template to use in register component html

## form builder service
- convert new form group and new form control with arrays of fb group injected in register component

## expanding form 
- order not important in register component
- radio buttons dont need validator
- add in template

## adding a reusable date input
- html5 date picker is not implemented on all browsers (safari has none)
- use java scrip to create date picker
- ng angular packages comes with date picker 
- add in shared module

- cd _forms
- ng g c date-input --skip-tests
- https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/datepicker

- set max year in register component for 18+

## updating api register method

# ========= SECTION 13 =========

## paging and sorting learning goals
- implement pagination on api and clinet
- deferred execution using IQueryable
- how to implement filtering on api and client
- sorting on api and client
- using action filters
- adding time ago pipe
- caching the client for paginated rescources

## pagination
- helos avoid preformance problems
- parameters are passed by query string (in url)
- page size should be limited
- always page results

## deferred execution
- expression tree
```
context.Users  (IQueryable<USer>)
    .where()
    .orderby()
    . take(5)   << pagination
    . skip(5)   << pagination
    .asQueryable() 

 // execution of query
    .tolistasync()
    .toarrayasync()
    .todictionaryasync()

    .count()   << singleton query
```

## api pagination
- not paging in user repository
- add helper for pagedList
- add helper class for paginationHeader information
    - client will pull from api request header
    
- add extension method to add header to http response
- pass extension props to helper in the same order helper expects them
- serialize header name as json
- add cors header to make custom header available
- create helper class to receive pagination perameters from user(UserParams)
    - check if user set page size is not greater than default max page size
- update i/userrepository to return paged list and take in userparams
- pass info fron the paged list created in user repository to the http response header in user controller
- add pagination header in users controller 
- add [FromQuery] sttribute tag to users controller to get the parameters from query string
- add options to change json response for pagination header be camelcase not titlecase

## client pagination
- give pagination a typescript model in _models
    - must be the same as in response header
- create class for pagination in the ts file
- modify get members method in member service
    - turn off caching for now
- HttpParams takes care of serializing and adding params to query string
- {observe} now gives full response body

- change how to return members in  member list component
    - change menber observable back to membeber type
    - use loadmembers to give props mannually for now
    - adjust component tempalte from members$ to members
    
- bootstrap pagination component
- https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/pagination
- add in shared module
- for root () angular boot strap components
- add in member list template
- add page changed method in component

## filtering api
- dont return logged in user
- choose gender to return 

- add in user params
    - current username
    - gender

- user controller
    - add default opposite gender unless specified

- user repository 
    - add .AsQueryable()
    - query is currently off of member dto dont want that
    - want to map to member dto AFTER filtering 

- adding additional filter parameters
    - add props in user params
    - user repository

- user Dto
    - send back gender with UserDto
- Account controller
    - update DTOs to return gender
- User.ts
    - add knwon as nad gender
    - add known as to known as in nav
- userParams.ts in _models
    - create class to store user params
- member service takes in userPArams model
    - refactor paginated header code to be reusable
- member list component
    - refactor code in member list

## adding filter buttons to the client
- add reset filters function in member list component
- member list template
- member card template to add age to display card

## sorting api (ordering)
- userparams.cs add order by
- user repository 
    - add switch for order by 

- action filter
- do somethign before or after an action
- access to context before and action executed after context
    - check if logged in
    - access username
    - access repository
    - access user object
    - set user last active property
    - add as service in application service extesions
    - go to where controllers are deriving from (base api controller)
    - add attribute to base api controller to give access to action filter
    - mske a reuest on postman and see last active time change
- currently using get user by username async, ineffiecient because it incluces all photots, should switch to get user by id async.
- set id in token so token has access to id and username
    - use unique name for username and name id for id on new claim in token service
    - upodate claims prinicpal extension now that username type is different
    - replace name identifier with name for unique name 
    - create new extension to get id and return int of id
    - in log iser activity swap username for user id and use get user id


## sorting on client
    - ngx buttons https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/buttons/examples

    - two way binding with 3 buttons to switch off true and false for what way to sort on client
    - sort by sctive or created on with filters by age 
    - modify members service to send order by param in query string

- dates
    - time ago (last active time)
    - {{member.created | date}}
        - date: 'mediumDate'
        - date: 'dd MMM yyyy'
    - ngx time ago 
        - `npm install ngx-timeago`
        - https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-timeago
        - {{member.lastActive | timeago}}

## restore caching for members settings
    - remember filters
        - remember queries of page and gender etc
        - look in members service
        - use user params as key
        - for each key/query store response
        - use map to store key adn vfalues
    - go to api get members and dont have them in cache, if in cache and query is identical then retrive from cache
        - stores page results in memory if query is same

- save member cache settings for member detail page
    - extract member from map with matching key 
    - load member detail from cache and not api
    - navigation extras can get details of teh member >> will not work in future <<
    - member object is available in detail page after visiting the members results, just need to extract it from the list of results 
    - get all values of member cache, dont need keys
    - having an array of users in memory and going to member detail of member not in memory will produce a second array, only want one array to find all users in
        - paginated results, paginated result
    
    - use reduce function now that there are two ararys of members
    - concat results into empty array;
        - each new member loaded will be added to the array of loaded members 
    - members can be duplicated in this arr from two different queries
        - lisa stored from age filter and one lisa from 5 users with no filter
        - this is ok because users will be found by first match to search
    - user params stored in component get lost everytime, move them to service to keep
 
- caching filters in member list coponent
    - acc service is injected into memberserviec beware circular references, acc service cannot go back to member serviec
    - set user params in component constructor, get them from mem service
        - still updating inside component, must update service from component
        - before getting members set current user params
        - update component reset filters from service filters
        - in member list component add user param updates to reset filters and page changed before loading members again


# ========= SECTION 14 =========  

## adding like user entity learning goals
- many to many relationships
- configure entities in the DBcontext
    - AppUser can be liked by many AppUsers
    - AppUser can like many AppUsers
    - .net5 can create table automatically, but doesnt work well with this relationship
    - self referencing many to many
    - use join table called user like
        - source user id
        - liked user id
- fluent api
    - tell api 
        - APPUSER has one SOURCEUSER with many LIKEDUSERS
        - APPUSER has one LIKEDUSER with many LIKEDBYUSERS


- adding new entity
    - padingation for likes
    - entity
    - repository 
    - controller 
    - component
    - paging
 

## adding a likes entity
- give app user two new collections
    - users they like
    - users have liked 
- create join entity
    - add 4 props to UserLike for source user and liked user and their ids
    - add two ICollections of UserLike to AppUser entity
- configure in datacontexg
    - photos didnt need a dbset because were not doing anything with them, this needs configuring
    - create an override for entity framework builder
        - specify that it has a key, because we did not specify a primary key fo rthe entity
        - combination of source user id and liked user id
        - define primary key and relationships
- make new migration
    - creates table likes with two columns source user id and likes user id

## adding likes repository
- methods
    - get individual likes
        - <UserLike>
    - get user with thier likes
        - <AppUser>
    - get likes for a user
        - <IEnumerable<LikeDto>>
        - liked
        - liked by
- return a DTO
    - to select properties interested in for returning 
    - only info needed to create a member card

- create likes data class and inherit interface
- inject datacontext
- plug in application service extensions 
    - add scoped repository, implementation class

## implementing likes repository
- use find async for get user like
- user include and first or default to get list of users user has liked
- for get user likes return IEnumerable lists of who the user has liked or who the user likes
    - use the userid for the join table and has if statements to decide which side of teh id it will return 
        - users like this user
            - right side of table
        - user likes these users
            - left side of table
    - the return Dto does not have enough properties to need AutoMapper, would write equal code to configure it anyways

## contorller methods for likes
- need acces to/inject lieks and user repositroies
- dont need to return to client, already know the primary key of created entity is going to be, client does not need it

- post man check
    - send post /add like for todd from lucy
    - 404 not found
        - common
        - restart api
        - file watcher needs a restart for new endpoints
    - 200 response
        - lucys likes : todd
        - lucys liked by : none

## setting up the likes functions in the angular app
- user member service for likes
    - add like
    - get likes
        - liked or liked by

- member card.ts
    - inject member service and toastr service
    - add like

- member card template .html
    - add click event to heart button
    - 400 error not coming from API
        - httop error response displaying status text, not error message (custom)

- error.interceptor.ts
    - check of error is an object and add an else when it is just a string, this will give us our custom string messages

## adding likes component
- lists.component.ts
    - store members 
        - not full members so user Partial, now optional properties for coplete member
    - inject members service
    - update return type for members, cannot be observable since it is a partial member

- members service.ts getlikes
    - returns <Partial<Member[]>>


- list component. html
    - add turnary for what the predicate is/ what is displaying
    - add buttons to change predicate and reload likes
    - add ng for to display members that fit the queryable

    - likes displaying all users 
    - check network tab and check request, predicate is not making it into the query URL
- membersservice.ts
    - getlikes http get 
    - WAS (this.baseUrl + 'likes?=' + predicate)
    - SHOULD BE (this.baseUrl + 'likes?predicate=' + predicate)

## paginate API and client likes
- take pagination from user params
- create a new class to store user params pagination and any other classes that need it can inherit 
- inherit Pagination Params inside userparams and likes params
- likes params needs predicate and user id

- ilikes repository
    - instead of returning ienumerable return paged list
    - replace the string predicate and int user id, pass in likes params 

- likes repository implementation class
    - configure to paginate
    - return paged list
    - recive predicate and user id from likes params

- likes controller
    - replace predicate and user id with likesparams
    - now returns a paginated response
    - check in postman that pagination headers are appearing
        - curretn page
        - page size
        - total count
        - total pages

## paginatin glikes on the client
- members service
    - get likes needs pagination headers now
    - reuse methods to get pagination headers and return paginated result
    - get likes needs predicate page number and page size
    - instead of creating a class for 3 properties, just add them to the list componetn mannually
- list component
    - create page number and size properties 
    - pass into load likes, get likes
- members service
    - get likes, get paginated results should be type <Partial<Member[]>>

- member list component html
 copy paste pagination into list ocmonent html

- check network tab 
    - request > headers > pagination headers are there
    - drop page size to 2 to check pagination works

## getting message thread
- instead of user IDs use strings of current username and string of recipient username
    - for consistency, used everywhere else
    - always have access to curerent username from context in controller
    - 

- mark any messages not read as read
    - get messages in memory
    - do sometihing 
    - map to dtp
        - cannot work with dto to update database
        - execute request into list and work with messages in memory
- get messages where recipient is equal to user and vice versa for sender

- when thread is open messages are marked as read
- because not projecting, eagerly load photos for users 

- any unread messages where recipient is current usernam ewill be marked as read

- steps of get messages thread ()
    - get convo
    - find out if unread of current user
    - mark as read
    - return essage dtos

- message controller
    - takes in name of other user, already have access to current user

## setting up message thread in angular client
- need interface in _models
    - in postman copy message object an dcopy paste into [Json to ts](http://json2ts.com/)

- new service for messages
    - cd client/src/app/_services 
    -  ng g s message --skip-tests

- message.service.ts
    - inject httpclient 
    - need baseurl
    - method to get messages
    - get messages is a paginated result so we need access t opage number size and container 
    - dont have access to these methods in client ts file
        - they are private in member service.ts
        - could copy them into their own file but...
            - need to think baout paginated result, need to use http
            - can pass http as parameter and service can inject it
            - could copy paste them into services
    - _services paginataed result helper.ts
        - cut and paste from members service
        - since they are not inside a class so now they need to be functions
        - export both functions
    - go back to members ts and fix errors
        - fix get likes and get members
        - remove this. 
        - inject htis.http

     - fill out get messages in message service

- messages component .ts
    - fill out load messages and paginate result

- messages template .html
    - loop through messages

- restart api and angular to check if messages show
    - for testing change container status from unread to outbox and inbox

## designing the inbox
- add radio buttons with click handlers to change container displayin gunreads/inbox/outbox
- check if it is asking for inbox or outbox and show messages for reciving or sending
- add photos
- add css to round photos and max width


## adding message thread in client
- message thread will be through user card message icon, or user detail message tab
- message service .ts
    - get message thread
    - no pagination for now, add later

- new comp for messages
    - src/app/members
    - ng g c member-messages --skip-tests

- members-messages.ts component
    - load messages ()

- members messages html
    - ng for loop message of messages and display content fof test

- member detail .html template
    - add messages component

- two loading icons when member detail opens
    - loading member
    - loading messages
    - need to load messages at the same time as meber later

## styling the message thread
- last html code in application

- member messages .html
    - use card
    - check if there are no messages 
    - display sender images
